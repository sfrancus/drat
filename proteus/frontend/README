To run the pages, you should do the following:

1. Navigate to the frontend foloder. (cd ~/frontend)
2. Run the following command: (php -S localhost:8000)
3. Go to the browser and type in a browser: localhost:8000
4. To see the second page, type in a browser: localhost:8000/second.html

So far, the data is hard-coded, so there is no upload availability in the login page, but once the data becomes available, I wil be able to use it to draw the graphs using the available data.
